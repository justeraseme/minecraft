# Adventure Tools
Adventure Tools is a Fabulously Optimized-like modpack that 
tries to imagine what a client of my very own would look like.
With custom credits and branding, convenient quality of life
improvements, tracking features and convenience mods, maybe
we can make something nicer than a client.

Apart from 1.21.8, all versions are WIP and very early in
development. Adventure Tools is based on justeraseme/minecraft
and is generally considered the "modpack" version of it.

**No builds of Adventure Tools are available at this time**.
