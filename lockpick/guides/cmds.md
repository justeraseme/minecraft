# Commonly featured commands

| Command | Bad? | Should be blocked | Use |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | 
| `/help` | No | Owner's choice | Displays a helpful message. Sometimes custom set (i.e: custom help messages), but usually either displays pages of commands (Bukkit-based) or just one long message of available commands (Vanilla & Modded). If this is blocked, the server owner either has a good reason to hide the available commands, or uses default permissions. |
| `/plugins` | No | No | Displays all installed plugins on any Bukkit-based server. If this is blocked, the server owner has chosen to hide the plugins they use, for any reason from gatekeeping to hiding the dirty secrets they have. |
| `/vote` | Sometimes | User preference | Displays messages on some websites where you can vote for the server. If this gives rewards, that is bad and should count as a strike. |
| `/baltop` | Sometimes | Owner's Choice | Displays the top ten players with the most balance. Very common on economy servers. The "Sometimes" is because most P2W servers have economies, the command on it's own is not bad. |
| `/ah` | Yes | User Preference | Pulls up the Auction House. Commonly used by problematic servers, hence the Yes. |
