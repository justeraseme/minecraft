# Modding Launchers
(a.k.a. "modded launchers", "modpack launchers", "what you probably want")
| Name | Description | Author | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [üèÜ Modrinth App](https://modrinth.com/app) | The Modrinth App is a unique, open source launcher that allows you to play your favorite mods, and keep them up to date, all in one neat little package. | Modrinth | Beginner friendly option for modding. Only allows browsing Modrinth and has none of the advanced features Prism has. **Use [this fork](https://git.astralium.su/didirus/AstralRinth) to play for free with Ely.by skins or without an account**. |
| [üèÜ Prism Launcher](https://prismlauncher.org/) | An open source Minecraft launcher with the ability to manage multiple instances, accounts and mods. Focused on user freedom and free redistributability. | Prism Launcher team (& contributors) | Fork of MultiMC with added mod management, Java management, and other features. This is my personal favorite launcher, but it might be a bit much to look at for beginners. **Use [this fork](https://github.com/ElyPrismLauncher/ElyPrismLauncher) to play for free with Ely.by skins or [just play offline](https://rentry.co/prism4free)** with no skins. |
| [‚≠ê ATLauncher](https://atlauncher.com) | ATLauncher is a simple and easy to use Minecraft Launcher which contains 154 modpacks for you to choose from, as well as the ability to browse and install packs from other platforms including CurseForge, Modrinth and Technic. | RyanTheAlmighty | ATLauncher is a solid mod management launcher with minimal issues in most cases. It swaps out the MultiMC based UI and some fancy stuff for Server management and creation. |
| [‚≠ê SKLauncher](https://skmedix.pl/) | The simplicity and elegance of our launcher will make it easy for you to find your way around. In addition high speed and lightweight guaranteed, lack of built-in ads and, above all, full security. Join our community and enjoy the possibilities for free. | SKLauncher Team | Fan favorite between pirates. |
| [Crystal Launcher](https://crystal-launcher.net/) | Crystal Launcher is an alternative and unofficial Minecraft launcher with a built‚Äëin modpack repository. | ??? | Poland based Minecraft launcher. Supports both Microsoft and Offline accounts. |
| [GDLauncher](https://gdlauncher.com/) | GDLauncher Carbon is a simple, yet powerful Minecraft custom launcher with a strong focus on the user experience  | Gorilla Devs | Legacy branch is deprecated, but might be more desirable. Carbon is their new launcher, but **it has ads** and you have to pay to remove them. You could try [this fork](https://github.com/Official-Husko/GDLauncher-Carbon-adless) which doesn't have them (at your own risk, of course). |
| [Hello Minecraft! Launcher](https://github.com/HMCL-dev/HMCL) | A Minecraft Launcher which is multi-functional, cross-platform and popular  | HMCL Team | Commonly shortened to HMCL. Homepage is in Chinese. |
| [Quantum Launcher](https://github.com/Mrmayman/quantumlauncher) | A simple, powerful Minecraft launcher written in Rust | Mrmayman | Compact and minimalist alternative to Prism Launcher. **Enable "Download Assets" on modern versions** to avoid text issues. May not launch some jarmods, most notably Alpha4j. Manually point the launcher to Javaw.exe |
| [XMCL](https://xmcl.app/en/) | An Open Source Minecraft Launcher with Modern UX. Provides a Disk Efficient way to manage all your Mods! | Voxelum | Alternative launcher with a Discord-like UI. **Saves disk space by using symbolic and hard links. Uses Microsoft Store (UWP)**. |

# Clients and Client Launchers
(a.k.a. "strictpacks" (as described in [my old client rant](https://rentry.co/mclients)))  
You should still use alternative mods for [Lunar](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/latest/lunar/) and [Feather](https://microcontrollersdev.github.io/Alternatives/latest/feather/)'s features where possible.
| Name | Description | Author | Notes |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| [‚≠ê SkyClient](https://skyclient.co/) | An open installer to help you get all of the assets you need for Hypixel. | SkyClient team | 1.8.9 client based on Forge that's mainly intended for Hypixel users, however if all you play is 1.8 and you don't need anything else, Skyclient might be worth a look. |
| [‚ú® LabyMod](https://www.labymod.net/en) | Upgrade your Minecraft client experience to the next level. | LabyMod team | Labymod is a cool alternative to Lunar. It has a launcher for those who want something to be "launched" like Lunar but also has options for Prism users like myself, and can be installed as a mod in most cases. |
| [Axolotl Client](https://modrinth.com/mod/axolotlclient) | The most configurable HUD mod combined with everything else you might need to play - Your mod for the optimal PvP experience. | AxolotlClient team | AxolotlClient is a cool client mod for mod users. It might be too barebones for some, but it's a really cool alternative. |
| [Lunar Client](https://www.lunarclient.com/) | A modpack for all modern versions of Minecraft! | Lunar Team | Really ironic I put this here. It's an okay choice if you don't care about any capacity about modding or anything, but it's listed on Sodium's Supported Launcher list of "Launchers with known issues" list, so you should probably look for something else. |
