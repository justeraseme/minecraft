# justeraseme/minecraft
I wanted to share resources and my favorite mods with friends. 
I happened to also have a few friends who recently picked up modding. 
The only problem is that all the other lists either are too broad with
major versions (TheUsefulLists, which also takes months to update), are
outdated, have bad advice or don't cover all bases (radke6's guide only 
goes up to 1.21.1).

So, I bloated the optimization guide space with another list and stapled
a tacky resources page to it.  
Good as new!
