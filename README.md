# justeraseme/minecraft
I wanted to share resources and my favorite mods with friends. 
I happened to also have a few friends who recently picked up modding. 
The only problem is that all the other lists either take months to update 
(TheUsefulLists is community maintaned), or don't cover all bases (radke6's 
guide only goes up to 1.21.1).

So, I made another list so I could share my knowledge.
