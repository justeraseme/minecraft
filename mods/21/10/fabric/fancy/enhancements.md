| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Chest Tracker](https://modrinth.com/mod/chest-tracker-port) | Unknown | Client | Client side item storage - remember where you've put things. | Linked is a port. The text above chests doesn't currently render for unknown reasons (at least on my end) | 
| [Item Descriptions](https://modrinth.com/mod/item-descriptions) | Unknown | Client | This mod adds unique descriptions for all blocks, items, enchantments, effects, and mobs - built in a way that makes it easy to add modded content. | Seems to cause rare crashes when Jade is installed. |
| [Packed Packs](https://modrinth.com/mod/packed-packs) | Async Pack Scan | Client | Pack resource and data packs into profiles with multiple selection, drag and drop, and extended mouse and keyboard controls. | Appears to cause crashes when either Async Pack Scan or LibJF is installed. |
