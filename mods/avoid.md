| Mod | Incompatibilities | Description | Why To Avoid |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| [Culler](https://modrinth.com/mod/culler) | Unknown | Boosts performance by culling distant entities and block entities. | Raised CPU usage by about ~10-30% in testing, which was noticable enough to cause very subtle temperature control issues |
| [Left Hand Trick](https://modrinth.com/mod/left-hand-trick) | Unknown | This makes it so locally you see your right hand, but other people see your main hand left hand. (if set left) If set main hand right, it looks left. | Seems to cause visual issues |
