# Game Performance since 1.21.5
tl;dr: OptiFine skipped 1.21.5, Sodium has reported performance regressions, go earlier if you can.

## What Happened?
On March 25th, 2025, update 1.21.5 for Minecraft: Java Edition released. Most of the additions were mostly aesthetical, such as the new mob variants for some of the game's passive mobs, new plant focused blocks and new spawn egg textures. However, this version of the game also introduced breaking changes that threw off a lot of performance mods.

A version of OptiFine for 1.21.5 would not come out, and Sodium would report on their 1.21.5 release on April 3rd, 2025, that there had been performance regressions, likely caused by rendering engine changes. Versions since then are believed to have "performance regressions". Sodium has decided to wait for Mojang to calm down on their rendering chaos before working on these versions.

## That sounds scary, what can I do? Will I notice any issues?
Unfortunately, you can't do much. If you are on a version later than 1.21.6, you will have access to OptiFine like normal (why would you want to though) and Sodium will be available, but **your only option on 1.21.5 is Sodium**. And if you're smart, you won't settle for no mods.

You can still optimize versions past 1.21.4 like normal, and for the most part, things will be smooth sailing. 1.21.5 allegedly already has performance mods exclusive for it (Flourium specifically) already, and most of mods you use normally are already updated. Your performance could be lower than expected, or perhaps you might not even notice a thing.

It is very possible that you might not notice a difference, but it is still **highly** recommended to avoid 1.21.5+ for the time being if you can. If you are in a modded enviornment or have control of the version, 1.21.1 is recommended for the wider selection of mods using it as an LTS version over 1.21.2+.
