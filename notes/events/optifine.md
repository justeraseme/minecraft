# You shouldn't be using OptiFine
This is a very ironic statement, considering OptiFine is present on the list for versions where a Sodium alternative isn't present, but with time, some better alternatives will come to light.  
You've probably heard it a thousand times. I'll list some reasons, give some alternatives and show you some places to read more.

## Reasons
- Poor mod compatibility. Some say it's been bad since 1.16+, a lot of old forums say the compatibility has always been bad.
- The optimizations have gotten weaker, there's better mods now.
- Native support for Luxforge only.
- It's closed sources.
- The updates are slow.
- They skipped 1.21.5, leaving your only option on that version to be, well, the superior option.


## Alternatives
If you're on 1.15+ on Fabric (or NeoForge >=1.21), just use [Sodium](modrinth.com/mod/sodium). Those on Forge (& NeoForge) have [Embeddium](https://modrinth.com/mod/embeddium), as long as you're not on 1.17. If you are, you're fucked, but I doubt you have a use case for Forge 1.17.x when 1.18 has more mods stuck on it anyway.  
If you feel you need Embeddium over Sodium, it's also available for some Fabric versions.

1.7.10 users have access to [Angelica](https://modrinth.com/mod/angelica). 1.8 has no alternative at this time.
