# Curseforge v. Modrinth
Curseforge and Modrinth have two different use cases. It may matter once in a blue moon, but if you don't actually know which one to use: **use Modrinth where possible, and use Curseforge only if you need it**.

## Why?
Many reasons! Firstly, Modrinth is open source, and is generally preferred by more developers.

## Misc Notes
Some additional things to note:


### Some mods may be updated more frequently on
Yeah. I'm serious. Some mods might be more up to date on one versus the other. 99% of the time, the mods will be on the latest version on BOTH platforms, but for a few specific mods, here's what I've noted:

__Format__
**Mod**: use [platform]
> Notes and reasons

***

**Cloth Config**: use **Curseforge**
> On Forge 1.18.2, CurseForge has a more up to date version of the mod than Modrinth does currently (as of 8/16/25. build 102 vs 135). I don't know why.
