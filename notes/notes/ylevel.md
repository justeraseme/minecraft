The best Y level for getting diamonds since 1.18 has changed, due to the new ore generation since 1.18.x.  
This threw off some old players and their preferences. This guide is basically an attempt to gather together the "widely" considered good coordinates, as well as some other players' preferences.

## The Graph
| Game version | Y Level | Notes | Other Y Levels used by miners
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| <=1.17.1 | 11 | The magic number for old terrain generation. Unsure if this also applies to pre-1.16. | 12(?) |
| 1.18.0 - 1.19.4 | -58 | The default number for the new cave generation. One of these two should be the good number. A lot of players say -59, but you might have more luck on -58. | -59 |
| 1.20.1 - 1.20.4 | -53 | The terrain generation didn't really change, but some say that you might be more successful at -53. I'm not sure if this is exclusive to these versions or not. | -59, -55, -54 (less lava lakes, allegedly) |
| 1.20.5+ | -58 or -53 | No changes from the last version. Just keep following previous advice. | Unknown |
