# How can I tell if Chat Reports are on?
> [!NOTE]
> This is the same list of steps as the one in the Current Events section.

There are a couple of ways. **You should follow these instructions**
**every time you join a server**, or else you may risk potential
complications involving the chat system.

Entries marked **(NCR)** involve stuff you can only check if 
you have the **No Chats Reports** mod installed. Remember to 
install **Mod Menu**, so you can configure mods in-game, 
**or you will not have a mods button**!

### 1. Bottom left indicator (NCR)
> [!CAUTION]
> If the server you're playing on is a realm, **stop the guide right here**.  
> You can get banned from a realm, even if nobody reports you, just for swearing.
> It doesn't matter if you trust the other players or not, as Mojang automatically
> scans chats.  
> You should consider a dedicated server if you haven't already.
> 
> More info can be found [here](https://github.com/Aizistral-Studios/No-Chat-Reports/wiki/The-Realms-Question).

If you use the NCR mod and didn't turn off the mod's effects in
the multiplayer menu, you can see a little button on the bottom right
of your screen when chatting. For **Fabulously Optimized** users, it
will look like a shield, but for regular mod users, it will very likely
just be a simple colored icon, perhaps a circle with a question mark.

Just send an innocent message (like "Hi everyone!") in chat and see what
happens! If you did not get a popup warning with two buttons when you sent
a chat message, open the chat again and check the bottom right!

From there, hover over the icon and read what appears.

If you got a popup warning, read the next two sections **carefully**.


### 2. System Message indicator
If you are not using a modded version of the game (i.e: Lunar Client, 
Vanilla), and/or you do not have No Chat Reports installed, you usually 
see these indicators by default.

If not, go to the main menu (or pause menu) and click **Mods**. It may be an icon. 
Search for, or scroll down on the mods list on the left until you find 
**No Chat Reports**  and open it. Click the icon to open the settings (or click 
the mod name and click the gear on the right).

Click the **Client** tab and and set **Hide system message indicators** to **No**. You can
also set the other indicators (Modified, unverified) to No, if you wish.  
Then just hit **Save & Quit**.

From now on, you will see an indicator bar to the left of chat messages if messages are
game messages, or unsigned. If it is  **grey**, and the text "Game message" 
appears, then the server actively  prevents chat reports on the server end. 
If it is (likely) **yellow** and hovering over it says "Unverified", the message
is unsigned and/or unable to be verified with signing.  

If it says "Modified", then the message may have been modified by the server 
and/or might not be the message you're expecting. If there is no indicator at all,
the server may be signing messages. **Continue onto #3**.

### 3. Popup warning when sending messages (NCR)
This assumes you are using completely default settings, which most users
will most definitely be.

If you got a popup warning when sending a message in chat, this is
usually **your last warning** before you send messages that are signed
by the client. **Sometimes it is not a sign of danger**, some servers
(most notably FishOnMC) display the grey indicator of hope, even if
the warning popup says you may be in danger.

From here, you should only click "Allow Signing" if you
are confident that you are safe and in an enviornment you feel you
are safe and can't be falsely reported in (i.e: a space with no
malicious actors, a safe place with reports OFF.)

If your messages have no indicator (**AND** you did the last
section properly, including double checking), **the server may be**
**signing messages**.

Continue to the next section **before** you assume that the server
has reportable messages.

### 4. Checking "Social Interactions"
> [!CAUTION]
> This may not actually mean your messages are unreportable.  
> Have caution as you would any other server with reports available.

If you are on a server that disables chat reports, this step **is**
**unnecessary**. You may need to bind the "Social Interactions" key
if this button is not bound. You have to be in a server to see
that button. **The default keybind is P**.


On some servers, servers may appear to sign messages, but will have
the option to report chat messages **OFF**. You can check this by
clicking the warning triangle icon on any non-self player in the
social interactions menu! If the "Chat messages" button is not
clickable, then chat messages cannot be reported, even if they
are signed.

### 5. Checking the "chat messages" reporting menu itself!
> [!CAUTION]
> This may not actually mean your messages are unreportable.  
> Have caution as you would any other server with reports available.

Sometimes if you try to report chat messages of other people, they
never show any chat messages in the reporting menu at all, **with no**
**exceptions**. To check this, just go to Social Interactions, click
a player's warning icon, click "Chat messages" and see if any messages
come up!
