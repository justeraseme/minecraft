# Adventure Tools does not have official distributions
Adventure Tools (currently) does not have any official modpack distributions. If you see a modpack based on Adventure Tools or using the name, it's not mine. :(

It's very likely the name use is coincidental, but somebody might at one point make a modpack with the Adventure Tools name. That's okay. As long as it's clearly labeled as not being made by me, I don't care.
